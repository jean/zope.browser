zope.browser
============

This package provides shared browser components for the Zope
Toolkit. It defines the base actors for an interaction with a browser,
including the publishing process, from the request to the response and
the MVC oriented components. This ensures the pluggability and the
general interoperability of the publishing mechanisms and protagonists.
