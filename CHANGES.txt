Changelog
=========

1.4 (unreleased)
----------------

Added definitions to the base browser publishing process, including :

  * IRequest and IResponse
  * IPublisher
  * Errors definitions with : IPublishingError, IBadRequest, INotFound
    and IRedirect
  * Views publishing help : IDefaultViewName, that permits to retrieve
    the name of the default view for a context.

This allows us to move toward a greater interoperability with other
systems, severing a lot of zope packages' ties with ``zope.publisher``,
where all these concepts were initially defined. ``zope.publisher`` will
now use these interfaces as mixins to create zope publication
specific definitions. Components that don't need the full blow
definition can now register on broader interfaces, making them
available to non ``zope.publisher`` aware applications.
